                        <li>Washington, officially the State of Washington, is a state 
                            in the Pacific Northwest region of the Western United States. 
                            Named for George Washington—the first U.S. president—the state was 
                            formed from the western part of the Washington Territory, which was 
                            ceded by the British Empire in 1846, in accordance with the Oregon 
                            Treaty in the settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute. The state, 
                            which is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, Oregon to the south, 
                            Idaho to the east, and the Canadian province of British Columbia to 
                            the north—was admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. 
                            Olympia is the state capital; the state's largest city is Seattle. 
                            Washington is often referred to as Washington state to distinguish 
                            it from the nation's capital, Washington, D.C.</li>

                            At 268,596 square miles (695,662 km2), and with more than 29.1 million 
                            residents in 2020, it is the second-largest U.S. state by both area 
                            (after Alaska) and population (after California). Texas shares borders 
                            with the states of Louisiana to the east, Arkansas to the northeast, 
                            Oklahoma to the north, New Mexico to the west, and the Mexican states of

                            and has a coastline with the Gulf of Mexico to the southeast.</li>
