    <!-- H1 and p is my first header and paragraph about the anime, Fire Force -->

    <h1>Fire Force</h1>
        <p>In Year 198 of Tokyo's Solar Era, 
            special fire brigades called the 
            Fire Force fight increasing incidents 
            of spontaneous human combustion where 
            human beings are turned into living infernos 
            called "Infernals".While the Infernals are first 
            generation cases of spontaneous human combustion, 
            with more powerful horned variations known as Demons, 
            later generations possess pyrokinesis while retaining 
            human form. The Fire Force was formed by combining people 
            with these powers from the Holy Sol Temple, The Tokyo Armed 
            Forces, and the Fire Defense Agency, and is composed of eight independent companies.

    <!-- H2 is smaller than H1. This header and paragraph will be about the anime, Naruto -->

    <h2>Naruto</h2>
        <p>A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks 
            Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, 
            one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in the 
            Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha 
            and the Fourth Hokage, Minato Namikaze seals the 
            fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki, 
            making Naruto a host of the beast; this costs Naruto's 
            father his life, and the Third Hokage returns from retirement 
            to become the leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often scorned by 
            Konoha's villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to a 
            decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events, 
            Naruto learns nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when 
            Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to Naruto. Naruto then defeats 
            Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka Umino.

    <!--H3 is smaller than H2. This header and paragraph will be about the anime, Hunter x Hunter  -->

    <h3>Hunter x Hunter</h3>
        <p>Hunters are licensed, elite members of humanity who are 
            capable of tracking down secret treasures, rare beasts, or 
            even other individuals. They can also access locations that 
            regulars cannot access. To obtain a license one must pass 
            the rigorous annual Hunter Examination run by the Hunter Association, 
            which has a success rate of less than one in a hundred-thousand. A Hunter 
            may be awarded up to three stars: a single star for making 
            "remarkable achievements in a particular field"; they may then be upgraded 
            to two stars for "holding an official position" and mentoring another Hunter 
            up to single star level; and finally upgraded to three stars for "remarkable 
            achievements in multiple fields".

    <!-- H4 is smaller than H3. This header and paragraph will be about the anime, Attack on titan  -->

    <h4>Attack on Titan</h4>
        <p>The plot of Attack on Titan centers on a civilization inside three walls. 
            According to the knowledge propagated locally, it is the last location where 
            humans still live. Its inhabitants have been led to believe that over one 
            hundred years ago, humanity was driven to the brink of extinction after the 
            emergence of humanoid giants called Titans, who attack and eat humans on sight. 
            The last remnants of humanity retreated behind three concentric walls and enjoyed 
            nearly a century of peace and the thought of venturing outside is frowned upon and 
            discouraged. To combat Titans, the country's military employs Vertical Maneuvering 
            Equipment, a set of waist-mounted grappling hooks and gas-powered propulsion enabling 
            immense mobility in three dimensions.
