    <h1>Fire Force</h1>
        <p>In Year 198 of Tokyo's Solar Era, 
            special fire brigades called the 
            Fire Force fight increasing incidents 
            of spontaneous human combustion where 
            human beings are turned into living infernos 
            called "Infernals".While the Infernals are first 
            generation cases of spontaneous human combustion, 
            with more powerful horned variations known as Demons, 
            later generations possess pyrokinesis while retaining 
            human form. The Fire Force was formed by combining people 
            with these powers from the Holy Sol Temple, The Tokyo Armed 
            Forces, and the Fire Defense Agency, and is composed of eight independent companies.</p>
